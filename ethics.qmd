# Ethical Challenges

## Data Transparency and Reproducibility
Without a clear documentation of data provenance and calculation methods, there are risks of this data being minsterpreted or misued in policy/academic contexts. This should be addressed by: 1. Follow established scientific methodlogies from the boundaries R package. 2. Provide documentation of all data sources and model assumptions within the dashboard. 3. Enable full reproducibility through Github. 4. Keep the project open-source in order to maintain validation and allowing for community input.
