### Background: Planetary Boundaries and "boundaries" R package.
In this section, I will establish the scientific and methodological groundwork for this project. I will first dive into the Planetary Boundaries (PB) framework as a foundation concept for quantifying global environmental system risk. Afterwards, I will go into what the boundaries R package is, the contribution it offers, and overall its analytical functions for the purpose of this project.
